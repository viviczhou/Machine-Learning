# EM Algorithm of Mixture of Gaussians


## 1. Introduction:

Gaol: Maximize log likelihood
Algorithm: EM Algorithm

In this assignment, I conducted experiments with different values of --cluster_num and --iterations, implemented tied covariances as well as the standard, separate covariance setting, and took note of trends in both training and development data.
